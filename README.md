## Intro. to Econometrics
- Finished problem sets from Professor Jeffrey Wooldridge's Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach Textbook
- Answers to exercises are my own work; however, I take no credit for the notes sections (Notes were either copied or heavily influenced by words in the text). I'd like to thank Professor Wooldridge for such a great publication.
